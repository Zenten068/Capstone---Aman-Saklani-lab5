## Layout and Responsiveness

- **CSS Grid (```grid-template-columns```):** Used extensively for the ```dest-grid```, ```package-cards```, and ```testimonial-grid``` to ensure content wraps naturally and maintains visual balance across different screen sizes.

- **CSS Flexbox (```display: flex```):** Used for micro-layouts like the steps and stats sections, and for aligning items in the header and newsletter sections.

- **object-fit: cover:** Applied to all destination and blog images to ensure they fill their container without distortion, maintaining a consistent height (220px).

- **Sticky Header:** The main navigation (```<header>```) uses ```position: sticky```; to remain visible while scrolling.
